//Existing notes should flow to the left of the page when notetaker starts


//Starting note page should just have a sample Note Title and Note Text space
//along with a button in top right for new notes


//clicking new note button should allow user to click and edit 
//inside of the note title and note text
//at this point the new note button should dissapear

//when content is entered in either title or text on the note
//the clear form button should populate

//when data is typed into text title AND text fields, 
//save button should be generated 

//clicking on any of the existing notes should populate that data
//in the placeholder title and text fields
//in the center of the page
//should also populate the new note button


//Aesthetic issue, but currently the note title and text fields are not
//positioned properly
//They should also have their content displayed without the form borders
